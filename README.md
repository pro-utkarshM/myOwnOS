# Building My Own Operating System (From Scratch)

Hey! I'm **Utkarsh Maurya**, and you’ve just landed in the heart of one of my most ambitious projects: writing a complete operating system from scratch.

This isn’t just a side project — this is me, going full throttle into the depths of low-level computing. From booting off a raw binary, enabling the A20 line, all the way into protected mode, writing my own interrupt handlers, and doing HDD I/O — everything is custom-built, step by step.

No frameworks. No shortcuts. Just real, bare-metal coding.
Want to try it out: go to [myOwnOS-dev-env](https://github.com/pro-utkarshM/myownos-dev-env), this is where you want to start.

## What’s This Project About?

I wanted to **understand how computers really work** — not just run code on top of a stack of abstractions, but build the stack *myself*. That meant starting from the boot sector and climbing my way up toward user programs, a file system, multitasking, and more.

This OS is being built using:
- **Assembly + C**
- My dev environment is Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)
- Tools: `nasm`, `gcc`, `qemu`, `make`, and raw grit

## Big Thanks

Two resources have been absolute game-changers:
- [OSDev.org](https://osdev.org) – the holy grail for OS developers
- low lEU – super clear explanations for tough concepts

If you're even thinking of writing your own OS, start there. And then... just start.
